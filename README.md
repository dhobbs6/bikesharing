The Purpose of this analysis is to analyze and display data from CitiBike NYC, in order to create a visual presentation for investors looking to start a similar business venture in Des Moines, Iowa. This analysis helps answer key questions such as: 

- What hour of day are bikes being used the most?
- How is bike usage broken down among men and women?
- Which day of the week is most popular for bike usage?
