# Bikesharing
An analysis of NYC CitiBike bikesharing data

## Overview
My Tableau story can be found [at this link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dillon.hobbs6519/viz/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis_16717250060600/Story1)

The Purpose of this analysis is to analyze and display data from CitiBike NYC, in order to create a visual presentation for investors looking to start a similar business venture in Des Moines, Iowa. This analysis helps answer key questions such as: 

- What hour of day are bikes being used the most?
- How is bike usage broken down among men and women?
- Which day of the week is most popular for bike usage?

The above image essentially shows that most trips only have about a 30 minute duration before we see a swift drop off heading toward the hour mark. People only seem to travel for about half-an-hour before stopping judging by the data.

The above image highlights a number of things. Firstly, from the heatmap, we can see that throughout the weekdays from 6AM to 9AM there is a ton of bike usage. Most likely commutting to work/school. Weekdays between 4PM and about 8PM we see even heavier traffic than in the mornings. The weekends show their normal high biking usage, but one piece of data that sticks out would be Wednesday. Wednesdays have their normal 6AM to 9AM rush and then diverges from following suit. It does not pick back up in the evening.

The above image essentially shows everything the previous image showed except it is broken down on the basis of gender. We can further see from this visual that males are seeing a much higher biking usage, while the females are following suit but to a lesser degree.

The above image essentially reinforces the male-dominated biking usage trend that we have been noting. The new bit of information offered by this heatmap shows a breakdown based on user type as well. We can see that the userbase is heavily dominated by male, subscribing bikers
